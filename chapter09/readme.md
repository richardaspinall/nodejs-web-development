# Chapter09: Websockets with Socket.IO

**Packages:**

https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io (Socket.io for websocket support)

https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport.socketio (for adding support to Passport for websockets )

## Initialization

The most important part of implementing the websockets library is it's structure and how it's initialized in the code:

- Because we had initially hardcoded the secret and store into the session set up (`app.use(session({...}))`), we need to pull those variables out into global variables. This is so we can use them in both the HTTP requests and Websockets

- Next we wrap `Socket.IO` around the server object and integrate passport. This takes in those global variables and adds the cookie parser as middleware

```js

// Wrapping Socket.IO around the server
export const io = socketio(server);

// Integrating Passport and CookieParsing
io.use(
  passportSocketIo.authorize({
    cookieParser: cookieParser,
    key: sessionCookieName,
    secret: sessionSecret,
    store: sessionStore,
  })
);
...

// Addiong session support to express (regular HTTP requests)
app.use(
  session({
    store: sessionStore,
    secret: sessionSecret,
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: true,
    name: sessionCookieName,
  })
);
```

## Extending our NotesStore classes for events

Because we had created an `AbstractNotesStore` class that every `NotesStore` extended, we can easily add our event emitter functions to it that the subclasses can call.

`notes/models/Notes.mjs`

```js
...
export class AbstractNotesStore {
  async close() {}
  async update(key, title, body) {}
  async create(key, title, body) {}
  async read(key) {}
  async destroy(key) {}
  async keylist() {}
  async count() {}

  // NEW:
  emitCreated(note) {
    this.emit('notecreated', note);
  }
  emitUpdated(note) {
    this.emit('noteupdated', note);
  }
  emitDestroyed(note) {
    this.emit('notedestroyed', key);
  }
}
```

Then in each subclass, we call these new functions from the approiate crud functions

`notes/models/notes-mongodb.mjs`

```js
  async update(key, title, body) {
    ...
    await collection.updateOne({ notekey: key }, { $set: { title: title, body: body } });
    this.emitUpdated(note);
    return note;
  }

```

## Updating our home page to handle events

`notes/routes/index.mjs`

Whenever an event is emited (created,updated or detroyed), we have a listner that calls the following `emitNoteTitles()` function and then emits to any client connected to the `/home` namespace. There are also "rooms" which differ from the "namespace" in that they are created by the server directly at when the client wants to connect. Namespaces can be connected by the client themself (still can use auth though).

The client side connects to the `/home` namespace which was created by the server

Ref:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10930286/socket-io-rooms-or-namespacing

```js
export const emitNoteTitles = async () => {
  const notelist = await getKeyTitlesList();
  debug(`socketio emitNoteTitles ${util.inspect(notes)}`);
  // Only emit this event to clients connected to the home page
  io.of('/home').emit('notetitles', { notelist });
};
```

```js
export function init() {
  // Creating a "/home" namespace so that clients on the home page will only recieve certain events
  io.of('/home').on('connect', (socket) => {
    debug('socketio connection on /home');
  });
  notes.on('notecreated', emitNoteTitles);
  notes.on('noteupdated', emitNoteTitles);
  notes.on('notedestroyed', emitNoteTitles);
}
```

## Adding debug tracing

In: `package.json` we added: `DEBUG=notes:*, socket.io:*`

This enables socket debug logs

## Updating notes when they are edited or deleted

In `notes/routes/notes.mjs` we added initilization for the socket to emit events when notes are updated or detroyed: `init()`. Additionally upon connecting to this namespace (`/notes` â€“ which we have aligned to the route), we have the socket join a specific room which is send by the client. We are using the note keys to name the "rooms"

In `notes/views/noteview.hbs` we added some JQuery to connect to the namespace and send a query to connect to a specific room (the key of a note). When the note is updated, some JQuery simply updates the note for anyone connected directly to it

## Messaging on notes

We are now adding messaging to notes and have it be live through websockets. They will show the username, a timestamp and the message.

### Implementation

1. Creating the data model `notes/models/messages-sequelize.mjs`
2. Adding to the notes controller: `notes/routes/notes.mjs`
3. Updating the view: `notes/views/noteview.hbs`

A lot was done to the view to handle the back and forth of messages and real time updating of the page without reloading the page. This was mostly done with JQuery and Bootstrap modals and cards for display.

## Summary

- Implemented `Socket.io` so that users can see real time updates on notes

- Added support for Passport on the websockets

- Added a new data model: messages and added support with Socket.io there too

- Manipulation of HTML with `jQuery`

- Used the `EventEmitter` class to send events across our server code.
